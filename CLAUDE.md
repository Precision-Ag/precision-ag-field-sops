# CLAUDE.md — rules for editing this repo

This repo is the Precision Ag field SOP site (MkDocs Material, deployed on
Cloudflare Pages). Follow these rules exactly. They exist so edits are safe,
consistent, and never break the build.

## Golden rules
1. **Content only.** Edit Markdown under `docs/`. Do **not** touch `mkdocs.yml`
   theme/plugin settings, or `docs/stylesheets/`, unless the task explicitly says so.
2. **One chapter = one file.** Chapters live at `docs/<book>/NN-kebab-name.md`
   where `NN` is a two-digit order number (`00`, `01`, …).
3. **Adding a chapter** = two steps, both required:
   a. Create the file (copy `templates/chapter-template.md`).
   b. Add a line for it under the correct book in `mkdocs.yml` → `nav:`.
   A file not listed in `nav` is invisible and will trigger a build warning.
4. **Never edit dates by hand.** "Last updated" is generated automatically from
   the git commit history. Just commit your change; the date takes care of itself.
5. **Always validate before finishing.** Run `mkdocs build --strict`. It must pass
   with zero warnings. `--strict` turns broken links and orphan pages into errors —
   fix them, don't ignore them.

## Front matter (top of every chapter file)
```yaml
---
title: Equipment Needed     # shows in the browser tab and breadcrumbs
---
```
Keep it minimal. Do not add `date:` — it's automatic.

## Callout / SWMS conventions (use these exact forms)
```
!!! danger "SWMS"          ← safety / SWMS blocks (red)
!!! warning "WARNING"      ← things that can ruin data or break gear (amber)
!!! note "NOTE"            ← useful context (blue)
!!! tip "TIP"              ← field shortcuts (green)
!!! info "AT A GLANCE"     ← chapter summary box
```
Indent the body text **4 spaces** under the `!!!` line.

## Repair cards (Equipment & Repairs and any maintenance book)
A **repair card** is one fault, always in this fixed order:

1. `### Symptom: …`
2. **Fix-type badge** — exactly ONE of these (reuse the callout colours, no CSS):
   ```
   !!! tip "FIELD FIX"        ← green: safe on site AND the part/tool is in the kit
   !!! warning "HOME FIX"     ← amber: needs a part/tool not carried, or a workshop
   !!! danger "STOP & CALL"   ← red: safety risk (fuel/12V/spring/load) or report-first
   ```
3. **Tools & parts** — tickable list, linked to the kit chapter (`01-field-kit.md`).
4. `!!! danger "SWMS"` — mandatory on every card.
5. **Steps** — every step `[CONFIRM: …]` until the person who does the job verifies it.
6. **If this doesn't work** — escalation, linked to `07-support.md`.

Copy `templates/repair-card-template.md` for each new card. Never write a mechanical step
as fact. The kit rule is the spine: **if the part/tool isn't in the kit, it's a home fix.**

## Adding a book = nav line(s) **and** a home card
When you add a book, do BOTH in the same change, or the card/nav order silently drifts:
1. Add the book's pages under `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml` (see rule 3 above).
2. Add a `grid cards` entry for the book in `docs/index.md` (copy an existing card).
`--strict` catches an orphan page; it does **not** catch a missing home card.

## Checklists and steps
- Checklist (tickable): `- [ ] item`
- Ordered steps: `1. step` (let Markdown auto-number; always start at 1.)
- Bullets: `- item`

## Images / screenshots
- Put image files in the **same book's** `img/` folder: `docs/<book>/img/`.
- Reference relatively: `![alt text](img/filename.png)`
- Name files descriptively: `polaris-mount-height.png`, not `IMG_4821.png`.
- Add a one-line italic caption under each image.

## Placeholders
- Unknown/unconfirmed steps must be written as `[CONFIRM: what's unknown]`.
- Never invent a field procedure. A blank `[CONFIRM]` is safer than a wrong step.

## Commit messages
`docs(dualem): add cable connection photos to Polaris setup`
Format: `docs(<book>): <what changed>`

## Branch workflow

Each book gets its own branch, so several books can be written and reviewed at the same
time without one book's half-finished edit blocking another's.

- **One branch per book**, named `feat/<book>-sop` (e.g. `feat/em38-sop`,
  `feat/grid-sop`). All work on that book — new chapters, photo passes, `[CONFIRM]`
  clear-outs, wording fixes — happens on its branch.
- **All testing and review happens on the branch, before it touches `main`.** That
  means, on the branch:
  - `mkdocs build --strict` passes with zero warnings.
  - `mkdocs serve` has been used to click through the book's own pages at least once.
  - Every `[CONFIRM]` in scope for this pass has either been resolved or deliberately
    left (not silently dropped).
- **Merge to `main` only once a book is reviewed and signed off** by the people who do
  the work (see README → "Replicating this repo" for the review-before-release rule).
  `main` is the live site — Cloudflare auto-deploys every push to it.
- Branches don't need to be kept in sync with each other. Two books can diverge for
  weeks while each is being written; they only need to reconcile at merge time, same as
  any normal PR against `main`.
- **Structural branches merge first.** A change that touches shared scaffolding (nav
  structure, folder layout, a new top-level book stub) — not a single book's content —
  should land on `main` before the book branches built on top of it merge, otherwise
  every book branch inherits a stale structure and drifts further at merge time.

## Local preview (optional)
`mkdocs serve` then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 — live-reloads as you edit.
