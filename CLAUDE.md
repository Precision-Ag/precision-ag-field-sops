# CLAUDE.md — rules for editing this repo

This repo is the Precision Ag field SOP site (MkDocs Material, deployed on
Cloudflare Pages). Follow these rules exactly. They exist so edits are safe,
consistent, and never break the build.

## Golden rules
1. **Content only.** Edit Markdown under `docs/`. Do **not** touch `mkdocs.yml`
   theme/plugin settings, or `docs/stylesheets/`, unless the task explicitly says so.
2. **One chapter = one file.** Chapters live at `docs/<book>/NN-kebab-name.md`
   where `NN` is a two-digit order number (`00`, `01`, …).
3. **Adding a chapter** = two steps, both required:
   a. Create the file (copy `templates/chapter-template.md`).
   b. Add a line for it under the correct book in `mkdocs.yml` → `nav:`.
   A file not listed in `nav` is invisible and will trigger a build warning.
4. **Never edit dates by hand.** "Last updated" is generated automatically from
   the git commit history. Just commit your change; the date takes care of itself.
5. **Always validate before finishing.** Run `mkdocs build --strict`. It must pass
   with zero warnings. `--strict` turns broken links and orphan pages into errors —
   fix them, don't ignore them.

## Front matter (top of every chapter file)
```yaml
---
title: Equipment Needed     # shows in the browser tab and breadcrumbs
---
```
Keep it minimal. Do not add `date:` — it's automatic.

## Callout / SWMS conventions (use these exact forms)
```
!!! danger "SWMS"          ← safety / SWMS blocks (red)
!!! warning "WARNING"      ← things that can ruin data or break gear (amber)
!!! note "NOTE"            ← useful context (blue)
!!! tip "TIP"              ← field shortcuts (green)
!!! info "AT A GLANCE"     ← chapter summary box
```
Indent the body text **4 spaces** under the `!!!` line.

## Repair cards (Equipment & Repairs and any maintenance book)
A **repair card** is one fault, always in this fixed order:

1. `### Symptom: …`
2. **Fix-type badge** — exactly ONE of these (reuse the callout colours, no CSS):
   ```
   !!! tip "FIELD FIX"        ← green: safe on site AND the part/tool is in the kit
   !!! warning "HOME FIX"     ← amber: needs a part/tool not carried, or a workshop
   !!! danger "STOP & CALL"   ← red: safety risk (fuel/12V/spring/load) or report-first
   ```
3. **Tools & parts** — tickable list, linked to the kit chapter (`01-field-kit.md`).
4. `!!! danger "SWMS"` — mandatory on every card.
5. **Steps** — every step `[CONFIRM: …]` until the person who does the job verifies it.
6. **If this doesn't work** — escalation, linked to `07-support.md`.

Copy `templates/repair-card-template.md` for each new card. Never write a mechanical step
as fact. The kit rule is the spine: **if the part/tool isn't in the kit, it's a home fix.**

## Adding a book = nav line(s) **and** a home card
When you add a book, do BOTH in the same change, or the card/nav order silently drifts:
1. Add the book's pages under `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml` (see rule 3 above).
2. Add a `grid cards` entry for the book in `docs/index.md` (copy an existing card).
`--strict` catches an orphan page; it does **not** catch a missing home card.

## Checklists and steps
- Checklist (tickable): `- [ ] item`
- Ordered steps: `1. step` (let Markdown auto-number; always start at 1.)
- Bullets: `- item`

## Images / screenshots
- Put image files in the **same book's** `img/` folder: `docs/<book>/img/`.
- Reference relatively: `![alt text](img/filename.png)`
- Name files descriptively: `polaris-mount-height.png`, not `IMG_4821.png`.
- Add a one-line italic caption under each image.

## Placeholders
- Unknown/unconfirmed steps must be written as `[CONFIRM: what's unknown]`.
- Never invent a field procedure. A blank `[CONFIRM]` is safer than a wrong step.

## Commit messages
`docs(surveying): add cable connection photos to Polaris setup`
Format: `docs(<book>): <what changed>`

## Branch workflow

Each book gets its own branch, named `feat/<book>-sop` (e.g. `feat/em38-sop`,
`feat/grid-sop`). All work on that book, new chapters, photo passes, `[CONFIRM]`
clear-outs, wording fixes, happens on its branch, not on `main`.

- **Work on the book's branch, not `main`.** Check out or create `feat/<book>-sop`
  before editing that book. A change that touches shared scaffolding (nav structure,
  folder layout, a new top-level book stub) is the one exception, since every book
  branch needs it, but that too is a branch of its own, not a direct edit to `main`.
- **`main` is the live site.** Cloudflare auto-deploys every push to it.
- **Only merge or push to `main` when Brandon has explicitly confirmed it in that
  session.** Finishing a book, or even having it look done, is not the same as
  approval. Ask, don't assume, even if an earlier session was told to push early.
- **One push to `main` at a time.** If more than one chat is working in this repo at
  once, each one works in its own git worktree, never the same checkout. Two sessions
  sharing one working directory race on the same staged changes and commit history,
  and a `git commit --amend` from one can silently drop the other's uncommitted or
  just-committed work with no error, exactly what happened on 2026-09-14 (a same-day
  export-flow fix was dropped this way and had to be redone). Confirm nobody else is
  about to push before you do.
- **Never merge a branch into `main` without first diffing it against `main`'s current
  state.** A book's branch can go stale fast while structural work lands on `main`
  underneath it, a branch cut before a restructure will *delete* the restructured
  content if merged blind. Check `git diff --stat main..<branch>` first and look for
  anything that reads as a deletion of newer work, not just as the branch's intended
  change.

## Local preview (optional)
`mkdocs serve` then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 — live-reloads as you edit.
